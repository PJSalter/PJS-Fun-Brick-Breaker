# PJS Fun Brick Breaker

### Bouncing Ball Intro:

###### - Welcome to this exciting retro brick smasher game where a user will move a PADDLE from side-to-side to hit a ball so that it bounces to break a brick. 

###### - The whole goal of the game is to destroy all of the bricks at the top of the screen by targetting them with the ball. But, if the ball touches the ground instead of the paddle then the user loses resulting to GAME OVER! To win the game, all the bricks need to be eliminated.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
